- SWCTA Class of 2026
- I like playing music!
- Interests in Digital Game Development:
-     Asset creation (Sprites, music, vfx, etc.)
-     Programming isn't my strong point, but I enjoy doing it.
-     I'd much rather create assets for a game though.
- I am currently learning javascript, but I would like to learn C# and Python as well.
